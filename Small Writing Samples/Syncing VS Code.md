# Syncing VS Code

Sometimes your branch gets out of wack and won't let you sync. Try these steps when that happens.

1. Open the Source Control view, click the three dots at the top, and select **Pull, Push>>Pull (rebase)**
1. Click the three dots again, click **Pull, Push>>Pull from**, and select **origin/main**.
1. Click the sync icon next to your branch name in the bottom left to sync changes.
